"""Object-storage adapter for memo binaries (e.g. original PDF bytes).

Thin wrapper over ``src.utils.storage`` that routes memo binaries to the
configured object storage (Cloudflare R2, AWS S3, MinIO...)
when one is configured, and otherwise signals the caller to fall back to
inline base64 in the store value.

The R2 public URL is intentionally NOT exposed in ``binary_ref`` — memo
downloads always stream bytes back through our own endpoint so that the
bucket can stay private and access control lives in the server layer.
